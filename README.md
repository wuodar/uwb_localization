# Improving UWB localization with the help of neural networks 

Implemented for one of my university courses. <br>
Tbh, it doesn't work, the training data is static, and the testing data is dynamic, model output is slightly better than raw localization.
## How to run
##### Create virtual environment

- Run command to create venv: <br> 
``` python -m venv venv_name ```
- Activate venv: <br>
```.\venv_name\Scripts\activate```
- Install dependencies: <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
##### Run console application in virtual environment.

- Run command: <br> 
```python run.py [ARGS] ```
- List of args with description: <br>
